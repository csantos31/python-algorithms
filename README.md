# Main Project

This project is a collection of three subprojects in Python, each with a unique functionality. Below is a summary of each one:

## Subprojects

### 1. **Jokenpo (Rock, Paper, Scissors)**
   - A classic game where the user can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the machine.
   - The game keeps track of wins, losses, and ties.
   - **Folder:** `jokenpo`
   - **Details:** [Read more in the Jokenpo README](jokenpo/README.md)

### 2. **Palindrome**
   - A program that checks if a word or phrase is a palindrome (i.e., if it reads the same backward as forward).
   - Removes special characters and spaces, and ignores uppercase/lowercase differences.
   - **Folder:** `palindrome`
   - **Details:** [Read more in the Palindrome README](palindrome/README.md)

### 3. **Reverse Array**
   - A program that reverses the order of elements in an array and displays the result.
   - Includes a function to display the original and reversed arrays in a formatted way.
   - **Folder:** `reverse_array`
   - **Details:** [Read more in the Reverse Array README](reverse_array/README.md)

## How to Run

Each subproject can be run independently. Navigate to the desired subproject folder and execute the corresponding Python script:

```bash
cd jokenpo
python3 main.py
```

```bash
cd palindrome
python3 main.py
```

```bash
cd reverse_array
python3 main.py
```
